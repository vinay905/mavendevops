and after few moments maven project will be configured 

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/vinay905/mavendevops.git using cli or Github Desktop
inside the maven project directory if you do not want to setup maven by yourself

dockerfile
FROM maven:3.5.3-jdk-8-alpine
COPY ./. /


3. Jenkins Pipeline Configuration
Configure the Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile) to build and run the Docker image.

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {  
        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/vinay905/mavendevops.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    bat "docker build --no-cache -t my-image:1 -f ./Dockerfile ."
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    bat "docker run my-image:1 mvn test"
                    }
                }
            }
        
    }    
}

4. Build and Run Docker Image
Build and run your Docker image locally to ensure everything works:

docker build --no-cache -t my-image:1 -f ./Dockerfile .
docker run -it --rm my-image:1 /bin/sh


5. Integrate with Jenkins
*Create a Jenkins pipeline job and set the definition to pipeline script from SCM.

*choose scm to Git
*set repo url to: https://github.com/vinay905/mavendevops.git
*choose branch: ./master
*set credentials to: none (as it is public repo)
*in scriptpath keep Jenskinsfile as it is

6. Run Jenkins Pipeline
Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to build and test your project:
it will trigger when a new commit will be made to the repo on master branch

Navigate to Jenkins.
Run the configured pipeline job manually to see the result.

Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions:

Ensure Docker permissions are correctly set for Jenkins.
Check Dockerfile and Jenkins pipeline configuration for errors.
